What is the nature and description of the request?\n\nDreamWorks is working with Red Hat GPS and Jaroslav Kysela on testing and implementing the snd-aloop ALSA driver to manage per-system audio latencies.  DreamWorks would like the kernel modifications and utilities to be offered in RHEL.\n\n   3. Why does the customer need this? (List the business requirements here)\n\nThe snd-aloop (kernel driver) can be used to redirect all PCM streams for the virtual ''loopback'' card back to the user space for further\nprocessing.\n\nIf the stream should be redirected back to real soundcard, one might use standard ALSA tools to do this job like:\n\n\tarecord -D hw:Loopback -f dat | aplay -D hw:RealCard\n\nUnfortunately, this method is not efficient and there are other issues like that the snd-aloop module uses system jiffies as clock source\n(the clocks for real soundcard and system jiffies should be synchronized).  The snd-aloop module was extended to accept time shift in range 80%-120%. The consumer of the stream can use this control to drive the playback timing acording the real soundcard clocks.\n\n   4. How would the customer like to achieve this? (List the functional requirements here)\n\nBecause of above problems, the alsaloop utility was developed. It can handle both adaptive time shifting or high-quality adaptive rate\nresampling (using libsamplerate library). As a bonus, the mixer controls can be redirected from the virtual soundcard created by the snd-aloop module to the real soundcard, so application have full control for the PCM playback operation.\n\n   5. For each functional requirement listed in question 4, specify how Red Hat and the customer can test to confirm the requirement is successfully implemented.\n\nDetails are located here:\nhttp://people.redhat.com/~jkysela/RHEL5/loop/BACKGROUND\n\nhttp://people.redhat.com/~jkysela/RHEL5/loop/\n\n   6. Is there already an existing RFE upstream or in Red Hat bugzilla?\n\nNo.  \n\n   7. How quickly does this need resolved? (desired target release)\n\nRHEL 5.6 is the desired release.  \n\n   8. Does this request meet the RHEL Inclusion criteria (please review)\n\nYes.\n\n   9. List the affected packages\n\nkernel\n\n--- Additional comment from spurrier@redhat.com on 2010-10-29 14:22:21 EDT ---\n\n=== In Red Hat Customer Portal Case 00368065 ===\n--- Comment by Spurrier, Scott on 10/29/2010 2:22 PM ---\n\nI think that we need to create the bugs also for the alsa-utils package\n(the alsaloop utility and a configuration script to setup the delay do\nnot belong to kernel but user space).\n\n                                        Jaroslav",

Pulseaudio thinks that they are blocked (it is OK for Intel but the first Loopback device is useable).

You may disable the udev hardware detection by commenting line ''load-module module-udev-detect'' in default.pa .\n\nThe output to Speakers only - try to play with the mixer settings .

But what about\nthird party apps using other interfaces, we need the audio delay to\napply similarly to their audio output too. Is that possible and\npractical to configure/manage? Also, is ALSA going to be deprecated soon\nperhaps (you comment about pulse being recommended has me wondering)? If\nso, do you have a roadmap/timeline. In fact any high level plans or\nschematics for audio support we can look at would be good.\n\nIf we chose to use pulse audio instead, and aussming the alsaloop driver\ncould somehow be used with (or under) it to similar affect, it seems\nlike there could be yet another layer adding more minimum latency to the\naudio chain? If so, the audio delay would be better implemented as a\npulse audio feature in that case, but could it also cater for third\nparty ALSA client apps?",

The easiest way to do that at this point is to basically panic the system when this condition occurs to generate a vmcore that we can analyze.  If this is possible, I've attached a patch in comment 15 that will panic the system in the right spot.\n\nLet me know if this is doable.\n\n--- Additional comment from Ayyanar on 2012-07-03 11:21:35 EDT ---\n\nRan with the patch given on comment 5 and hit panic. \n\nKernel panic - not syncing: qla2xxx: oustanding_cmds array on scsi_host 2 is full\n\nPid: 37, comm: kblockd/3 Tainted: G           ---------------  T 2.6.32-279.el6.panic.bz829739.x86_64 #1\nCall Trace:\n [<ffffffff814fd11a>] ? panic+0xa0/0x168\n [<ffffffff811625e0>] ? cache_alloc_refill+0x1c0/0x240\n [<ffffffffa01f4f16>] ? qla24xx_start_scsi+0x4e6/0x650 [qla2xxx]\n [<ffffffff81116855>] ? mempool_alloc_slab+0x15/0x20\n [<ffffffffa01f5876>] ? qla24xx_dif_start_scsi+0x7f6/0x13f0 [qla2xxx]\n [<ffffffff812815a0>] ? sg_init_table+0x30/0x50\n [<ffffffff8128163e>] ? __sg_alloc_table+0x7e/0x130\n [<ffffffff8136b5e0>] ? scsi_sg_alloc+0x0/0x60\n [<ffffffff81116855>] ? mempool_alloc_slab+0x15/0x20\n [<ffffffff81116963>] ? mempool_alloc+0x63/0x140\n [<ffffffff8136b9f9>] ? scsi_setup_fs_cmnd+0x79/0xe0\n [<ffffffff81363180>] ? scsi_done+0x0/0x60\n [<ffffffffa01dbdbc>] ? qla2xxx_queuecommand+0x2fc/0x370 [qla2xxx]\n [<ffffffff81363411>] ? scsi_dispatch_cmd+0x101/0x360\n [<ffffffff8136af0d>] ? scsi_request_fn+0x41d/0x790\n [<ffffffff81253de3>] ? ftrace_raw_event_id_block_rq+0x153/0x190\n [<ffffffff812554c1>] ? __blk_run_queue+0x31/0x40\n [<ffffffff8124f6f8>] ? elv_insert+0xf8/0x1a0\n [<ffffffff8124f7ea>] ? __elv_add_request+0x4a/0x90\n [<ffffffff81254ead>] ? blk_insert_cloned_request+0x7d/0xc0\n [<ffffffffa00023ac>] ? dm_dispatch_request+0x3c/0x70 [dm_mod]\n [<ffffffffa000387a>] ? dm_request_fn+0x18a/0x290 [dm_mod]\n [<ffffffff81255662>] ? __generic_unplug_device+0x32/0x40\n [<ffffffff8125569e>] ? generic_unplug_device+0x2e/0x50\n [<ffffffffa0002788>] ? dm_unplug_all+0x68/0x70 [dm_mod]\n [<ffffffff812503b6>] ? blk_unplug_work+0x36/0x70\n [<ffffffff81250380>] ? blk_unplug_work+0x0/0x70\n [<ffffffff8108c760>] ? worker_thread+0x170/0x2a0\n [<ffffffff810920d0>] ? autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0x40\n [<ffffffff8108c5f0>] ? worker_thread+0x0/0x2a0\n [<ffffffff81091d66>] ? kthread+0x96/0xa0\n [<ffffffff8100c14a>] ? child_rip+0xa/0x20\n [<ffffffff81091cd0>] ? kthread+0x0/0xa0\n [<ffffffff8100c140>] ? child_rip+0x0/0x20\ndo_IRQ: 0.137 No irq handler for vector (irq -1)\n\u00ffirq 16: nobody cared (try booting with the \"irqpoll\" option)\n \nBut unable to collect vmcore file due to below error on console:\n\nDo you have a strange power saving mode enabled?\nDazed and confused, but trying to continue\nUhhuh.

If we can't get a crash dump I can create a patch to capture the information using counters and print it to the error log.\n\n--- Additional comment from Ayyanar on 2012-07-03 14:08:59 EDT ---\n\nHit

There is just a large number of commands that are submitted in a short time that we're not getting responses for to clear out the outstanding_cmds array.

But after bumping this up to a higher value like say 16384, the issue is harder to reproduce, but eventually do hit it when ports are down.\n\n--- Additional comment from Ayyanar on 2012-07-20 06:50:10 EDT ---\n\nChad,\n\nGiven that we are hitting IO outages during fabric faults in our tests on RHEL6.3 QLogic FC, do you think the above QLogic command queuing problem is contributing to this?

There is a time when a port goes down and when we tell the FC transport that to block the port (essentially to start the dev_loss_timer) where we fill up with outstanding commands but obviously we're not going to get any response to those commands from a dead port so that might explain why you still see this with an value of 16384.\n\n--- Additional comment from Chad Dupuis on 2012-07-20 16:04:19 EDT ---\n\n(In reply to comment #33)\n> Chad,\n> \n> Given that we are hitting IO outages during fabric faults in our tests on\n> RHEL6.3 QLogic FC, do you think the above QLogic command queuing problem is\n> contributing to this?\n\nIt's probably contributing since once we're full we can't accept anymore commands until we start receiving responses to the outstanding ones.\n\n> Have you identified a fix for this yet?\n\nNo, not yet.\n\n--- Additional comment from Ayyanar on 2012-07-25 04:06:39 EDT ---\n\nMarking the severity as 'Urgent' as this seems to contribute towards IO outages on the host.\n\n--- Additional comment from Chad Dupuis on 2012-07-31 10:33:36 EDT ---\n\n\n\n--- Additional comment from Chad Dupuis on 2012-07-31 10:40:10 EDT ---\n\nNetApp, could you try the patch attached in comment 37?\n\nIt, as you proposed before, increases the size of the oustanding_cmds array but only to 2048 at this point.  We don't want to increase the size of this particular array since this memory will be allocated for the entire lifetime of the driver for each adapter.  However, since in previous testing it was shown that increasing the size of the array did help and further analysis of the initial dump taken showed that there can be a bursty behavior in how commands are submitted to the driver it seems to make sense to increase the capacity here.\n\n--- Additional comment from Ayyanar on 2012-08-06 10:06:11 EDT ---\n\n\n\n--- Additional comment from Ayyanar on 2012-08-06 10:10:17 EDT ---\n\nChad,\n\nRan test with patched kernel in comment #37 and message file attached.\n\nI am still seeing \u201cStart scsi failed\u201d messages only during FC port block test.\n\nAug  3 04:29:24 ibmx3650-210-104 kernel: qla2xxx [0000:1a:00.1]-3813:6: Start scsi failed rval=258 for cmd=ffff88028365e9c0.\nAug  3 11:59:24 ibmx3650-210-104 kernel: qla2xxx [0000:1a:00.0]-3813:5: Start scsi failed rval=258 for cmd=ffff880077b689c0.\n\nAug  3 04:28:24 ibmx3650-210-104 **NATE**: enabled switch port (29) on switch (brcd5300-210-38) for device (ibmx3650-210-104)\nAug  3 11:59:44 ibmx3650-210-104 **NATE**: enabled switch port (29) on switch (brcd5300-210-38) for device (ibmx3650-210-104)\n\n--- Additional comment from Chad Dupuis on 2012-08-07 10:05:20 EDT ---\n\nThe results at least are better.

This is the direction I believe we should head here.\n\n--- Additional comment from Martin George on 2012-08-21 04:13:03 EDT ---\n\nChad,\n\nDo you have any updates on this?\n\n--- Additional comment from Chad Dupuis on 2012-08-22 09:24:00 EDT ---\n\nHi Martin,\n\nStill working on this.

It still contains the changes that were in comment 37 but also adds:\n\n- A back-off algorithm when we run out of host resources.  This is done by throttling the queue depth of all devices attached to the adapter geometically (i.e. dividing by two), waiting for a settle period (60 seconds) and then slowly increasing the queue depth for each device on the adapter by 1 every 30 seconds until we hit ql2xmaxqdepth.\n\n- I've removed the \"fc_remote_port_chkready failed\" and \"Start scsi failed\" debug messages which are clogging up the system logs.\n\n--- Additional comment from Chad Dupuis on 2012-09-11 10:04:02 EDT ---\n\nAny update on this; does this help in your testing?\n\n--- Additional comment from Ayyanar on 2012-09-11 12:49:18 EDT ---\n\n\n\n--- Additional comment from Ayyanar on 2012-09-11 12:55:28 EDT ---\n\n>Any update on this; does this help in your testing?\n\nSince \"Start scsi failed\" messages are not logged, I am not sure we are hitting those conditions or not.\n\nIO delay (no IO progress during FC port block) is seen with this patch too.\nWill update the status once I am done with few more testing.\n\n--- Additional comment from Chad Dupuis on 2012-09-11 13:11:40 EDT ---\n\n(In reply to comment #51)\n> >Any update on this; does this help in your testing?\n> \n> Since \"Start scsi failed\" messages are not logged, I am not sure we are\n> hitting those conditions or not.\n> \n> IO delay (no IO progress during FC port block) is seen with this patch too.\n> Will update the status once I am done with few more testing.\n\nThank you for the update Ayyanar.

When hitting a QUEUE FULL scenario, the target expects the host to back off and wait for at least one command to return before resuming IO. Is that expectation met with this patchset?\n\n--- Additional comment from Chad Dupuis on 2012-11-06 09:42:23 EST ---\n\n(In reply to comment #64)\n> (In reply to comment #63)\n> > The \"Queue depth adjusted-down\" messages from this log are actually the\n> > result of queue fulls being reported by the target:\n> > \n> > Nov  1 02:52:34 ibmx3550-210-99 kernel: qla2xxx [0000:0c:00.0]-3820:0: QUEUE\n> > FULL detected. \n> > \n> > I did not see any messages that pointed to resource exhaustion on the driver\n> > side.\n> \n> Just curious.

Is that expectation met with this patchset?\n\nThe target QUEUE FULL scenario is actually controlled by the SCSI layer in RHEL 6.  The qla2xxx driver simply returns the queue full status back to the SCSI layer and it is there that the queue depth is ramped down.  From what I can see in the SCSI layer, the host will ramp down it's queue depth but will not completely block.\n\n--- Additional comment from Martin George on 2012-11-19 14:00:52 EST ---\n\nChad,\n\nIgnore comment #60 - the IO outages there seem to be caused by a target bug (that causes frames to be dropped), and nothing to do with your patchset.\n\nAnd we've now run extensive tests with your latest patchset provided in comment #59. And the results look good - no longer seeing the above resource exhaustion issues on the QLogic host.\n\nSo requesting you to include this patchset now in the inbox qla2xxx driver.\n\n--- Additional comment from Martin George on 2012-11-19 22:57:43 EST ---\n\nChris,\n\nWithout this fix, the customer would end up seeing path failures & occasional long IO outages during fabric faults.

Thus we return failed for the abort operation which causes the SCSI error handler to escalate to the various reset where the task management command succeeds but then we fail waiting for DMA completion on a command that has already been returned.  This continues until we escalate to adapter reset which succeeds.\n\nI've attached a patch which prints out the reason for the abort failure as well as to change the return to SUCCESS if the command cannot be found to trigger the error handler to try a test unit ready to verify if the target is alive.  From the log files the target appears to have come back up from the drivers perspective so this should avoid the escalation of the SCSI error handler.",
