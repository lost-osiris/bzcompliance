#Bootstrap v3 datetimepicker widget

##Version 1
I've decided to do a major rewrite of the plugin. Version 1 is here in case you don't want to use Momentjs.

####New feature (1.0.5)!
* `defaultDate` is now an option to set the inital date. It accepts date objects like `new Date("November 12, 2013 00:00:00")` and `12/25/2013 00:00`
* partial support for moment.js

####New feature (1.0.4)!
* `format` is now an option in the locale files. If `format` is present in a language file it will default to that date format string (see Russian locale file for example).
